SCN-VR
======

This is a iOS 8.1+ static library for rendering VR content with SceneKit.

A Hello World demo has also been provided that has profile support, but its not that great.

Why does SCN-VR exist?
======

I did not want to pay for unity pro 4.x license, so I created this framework from the defunct ALPS-VR for unity.  ALPS-VR may not be defunct, but the website did redirect to a placeholder site when I checked.

Concerns
======

1.	I'm pretty sure the color correction shader has a problem and should be set to 0.0.

Future Work
======

1.	I really want to rewrite the distortion mesh logic, so the fragment shader could do less.
2.	Integrate google cardboard QR scanning (This is in Mobile VR Station)
3.	Integrate Mobile VR Stationâ€™s profile editing screen into SCN-VR.  So it could be used as a linked Storyboard.

Other Projects
======

1. I'm porting SCN-VR to ThreeJS
